        Everything that Arcane didnt add to Piltover and Zaun
    </h1>
    <p>If you hav watched the netflix series arcane you should have enjoyed it (it was that good) however for the average person,
        for the average person who has never played league (this is a good thing) you were unaware that most notable characters that were shown
        were characters on League of Legends. <strong>Jinx, Vi, Caitlyn, Heimerdinger, Ekko, Victor, Jayce, Mel, Vander</strong>(who goes by WarWick in LOL)
        are all characters from the <strong> Piltover and <a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/region/zaun/" target="_blank">Zaun</a> </strong>Region in League of Legends Lore. However, they missed quite a lot of people who i will now show you
        on this page. First of all, Blitzcrank:
